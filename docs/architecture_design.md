# Azure AKS High Availability Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture design for a highly available web application deployment in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with load balancing and database integration. The design follows Azure best practices and implements the four high availability pillars: redundancy, monitoring, recovery, and checkpointing.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Multi-Region Deployment

The solution implements an active-active high availability model with:

- Two identical AKS clusters deployed in paired Azure regions (e.g., East US and West US)
- Both clusters actively serving traffic
- Global traffic distribution via Azure Front Door
- Regional failover capabilities

### 2. AKS Cluster Configuration

Each AKS cluster includes:

- Control plane managed by Azure (99.95% SLA with Standard tier)
- Node pools spread across 3 availability zones within each region
- System node pool for Kubernetes system components
- Application node pools for web application workloads
- Database node pool with optimized storage for database workloads

### 3. Node Types and Specifications

| Node Pool Type | VM Size | Node Count | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|------------|---------|
| System | Standard_D4s_v3 | 3 | Kubernetes system components |
| Web Application | Standard_D8s_v3 | 6 | Web application containers |
| Database | Standard_E8s_v3 | 3 | Database containers with premium storage |

### 4. Networking Architecture

The networking architecture implements a hub-spoke model:

- **Hub Virtual Network**: Contains shared services like Azure Firewall
- **Spoke Virtual Network**: Contains AKS clusters
- **Virtual Network Peering**: Connects hub and spoke networks
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: Secure traffic between subnets
- **Azure Firewall**: Controls outbound traffic from AKS clusters
- **Private Link**: Secures connections to Azure PaaS services

#### Subnet Configuration

| Subnet | Address Space | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| AKS Nodes | 10.1.0.0/16 | AKS node networking |
| Pod CIDR | 10.244.0.0/16 | Kubernetes pod networking |
| Service CIDR | 10.0.0.0/16 | Kubernetes service networking |
| Application Gateway | 10.2.0.0/24 | Application Gateway subnet |

### 5. Load Balancing Configuration

The load balancing architecture consists of:

- **Azure Front Door**: Global load balancing across regions
- **Azure Application Gateway**: Regional load balancing with WAF protection
- **Kubernetes Ingress Controller**: In-cluster load balancing
- **Internal Load Balancer**: For internal service communication

### 6. Database High Availability

For stateful applications, the database layer implements:

- **Azure SQL Database**: With geo-replication and auto-failover groups
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: With multi-region writes for global distribution
- **StatefulSets**: For database workloads requiring persistent storage
- **Persistent Volumes**: Using Azure Disk with zone redundancy

### 7. Monitoring and Observability

The monitoring stack includes:

- **Azure Monitor**: For infrastructure and application monitoring
- **Container Insights**: For Kubernetes-specific monitoring
- **Log Analytics**: For centralized logging
- **Application Insights**: For application performance monitoring
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: For custom metrics and visualization

### 8. Security Components

Security measures include:

- **Azure Active Directory Integration**: For identity management
- **Azure Key Vault**: For secrets management
- **Network Security Groups**: For network traffic control
- **Azure Policy**: For governance and compliance
- **Azure Defender for Kubernetes**: For threat protection

## Pod and Node Structure

### Web Application Tier

- Deployed as Kubernetes Deployments
- Multiple replicas distributed across availability zones
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for automatic scaling
- Readiness and liveness probes for health monitoring
- Anti-affinity rules to distribute pods across nodes

### Database Tier

- Deployed as Kubernetes StatefulSets
- Persistent storage using Azure Disk with zone redundancy
- Backup and restore capabilities
- Data replication across regions
- Automatic failover configuration

## Failover and Disaster Recovery

The solution implements:

- **Active-Active Configuration**: Both regions actively serve traffic
- **Automatic Failover**: Azure Front Door routes traffic away from unhealthy endpoints
- **Data Replication**: Database data replicated across regions
- **Backup and Restore**: Regular backups with cross-region replication
- **Recovery Procedures**: Documented procedures for various failure scenarios

## Scaling Strategy

The solution scales at multiple levels:

- **Pod Level**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler based on CPU/memory metrics
- **Node Level**: Cluster Autoscaler to add/remove nodes based on pod scheduling
- **Regional Level**: Ability to add additional regional clusters if needed

## Network Traffic Flow

1. External traffic enters through Azure Front Door
2. Traffic is routed to the nearest healthy Azure Application Gateway
3. Application Gateway routes to the appropriate Kubernetes Ingress
4. Ingress Controller routes to the appropriate service
5. Kubernetes Service routes to the appropriate pod
6. Inter-service communication uses Kubernetes Services

## Deployment Strategy

The solution uses:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: For application deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: For automated deployment and updates
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: For zero-downtime updates
